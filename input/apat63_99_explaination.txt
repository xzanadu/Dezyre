About The Variables:
--------------------
1. The State/Country Code is a three-character code. A list of corresponding state and country
   names is included in the list_countries file. These codes are present for all patents in the file 
   (1963-1999).
2. The Assignee Identifier can be converted to the company name using the Coname file, 
   Assignee Identifier is available for patents granted since 1969. 
3. The Assignee type code is a one-character code having the following meaning:

     1    = unassigned
     2    = assigned to a U.S. nongovernment organization
     3    = assigned to a non-U.S., nongovernment organization
     4    = assigned to a U.S. individual
     5    = assigned to a non-U.S. individual
     6    = assigned to the U.S. (Federal) Government
     7    = assigned to a non-U.S. government
     8,9  = assigned to a U.S. non-Federal Government agency (do not appear in the dataset)
                 
4. The upper and lower bound for self-citations, together with the number of citations received,
   allow to compute the number of citations received having an assignee identifier (same for 
   citations made).
5. The application year is available for patents granted since 1967.
6. The number of claims is available for patents granted since 1975.
7. Grant Date is the number of days elapsed since 1.1.1960.
8. Main Patent Class list, as provided by the USPTO, is given in the attached Class file.
